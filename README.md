# Tutorial: How to set up a JS dev environment

Learn how to work like professional web developers by creating a JavaScript starter kit that you can reuse in all your projects. 

We’ll cover the big picture first, to help you understand why you need a JS boilerplate, then we’ll dive into the setup, step by step.

## Intro

As a self-taught front end developer with no CS or IT background, I had a hard time understanding why professional developers need so much extra stuff for their work.
My project folders included three files: index.html, styles.css and scripts.js, with some extra files in case of multi-page websites.

But that was all, and I couldn’t figure out why real web devs need so many additional tools, like pre-processors, linters, module bundlers or package managers.

I knew that I was missing something, but I just couldn’t put my finger on what it was. So I decided to change my approach to learning and to go back to the big picture. 
From there on, it all made sense.

## Target audience

This module is intended for beginner front end developers who are familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and want to learn how to structure their projects and 
work more efficiently by using pre-processors, linters, module bundlers and package managers. 

By the end of this course, you should have a clear understanding of what a JavaScript boilerplate is, why you need a development environment and how to set it up.

You’ll learn how to work like professional web devs and you’ll be well equipped for a junior role.
