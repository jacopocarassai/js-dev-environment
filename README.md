# JS dev server (boilerplate)

This is just a basic dev server for building modular ES6 Javascript applications, with minimum dependencies.

## Stack

1.  Node/NPM package management
2.  webpack
3.  Express for the development server
4.  Babel for transpiling JS
5.  ESLint for linting

## Author

## Commands

To start the server use:

    npm start

To create the production build:

    npm build

## Note

This repository is just for the project.
Since I didn't want to leave an index.js file empty, I have created a quick app for fetching random user API (randomuser.me)
